**Tip It** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Steven Hurtado**

Time spent: **13 hours** spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Circular Slider for the tip percentage
- [X] Stepper for splitting the bill
- [X] Rather than an entire new view, a pop over used for the default tip setting
- [X] Custom splash screen: random opening comment on "Tipping" at start up

## Notes

The most challenging aspect of this app would be formatting the string to output the proper amount with thousand separators and decimal separators based on region.
